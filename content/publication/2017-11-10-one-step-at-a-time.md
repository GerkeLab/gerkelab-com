abstract: |
  The aim of this analysis is to identify latent subgroups of women based on
  substance use, exposure to violence, and risky sexual behaviors and quantify
  discrete stages of behavior change over time. Data comes from 317 women
  recruited from a Municipal Drug Court System in the Midwest. All participants
  were interviewed regarding their substance use and sexual behaviors, as well
  as their exposure to violence at baseline, a 4th-month follow-up, and an
  8th-month follow-up. A latent transitional analysis (LTA), a longitudinal
  extension of a latent class analysis (LCA), was used to quantify discrete
  stages of behavior change. The results of our analyses revealed 4 distinct
  behavioral profiles in our sample: 1) women with high probabilities of risky
  sexual behaviors, exposure to violence, and crack/cocaine use, 2) women with a
  high probability of exposure to violence, and moderate sexual risk taking, 3)
  women characterized solely by a high probability of crack/cocaine use, 4)
  women with low probabilities of all factors. The proportion of women in latent
  statuses characterized by a high probability of crack/cocaine use did not
  substantially decrease over time. Women who experienced child sexual abuse,
  had a greater number of lifetime arrests, were older, and believed they had
  risky drug using behavior that needed changing at baseline were significantly
  more likely to be in higher-risk latent statuses. Targeted interventions
  tailored to crack/cocaine users, as well as a wide-spread need for
  trauma-informed interventions among females involved in the criminal justice
  system, are needed.
