abstract: |
  The increasing availability of public data resources coupled with advancements in genomic technology has created vast opportunities for researchers to examine the genome on a large and complex scale. To meet the need for integrative genome wide exploration, we present epiTAD. This web-based tool enables researchers to compare genomic structures and annotations across multiple databases and platforms in an interactive manner in order to facilitate in silico discovery. epiTAD can be accessed at <https://gerkelab.shinyapps.io/epiTAD/>.
