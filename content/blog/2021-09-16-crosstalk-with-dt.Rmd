This post demonstrates use of the [[crosstalk]]{.pkg} extension to coordinate filtering across multiple [[DT]]{.pkg} `datatable` widgets. The process is embedded in a standard R Markdown document, and is an example of [server(Shiny)-less](https://www.brodrigues.co/blog/2021-03-02-no_shiny_dashboard/) dashboarding/reporting.

## Objective

I often need to create reports or dashboards that present information across multiple tables from a database. Frequently, this deliverable is best displayed as a filterable view of the tables themselves in a web browser. This can happen when a primary key in one table (e.g. subject ID) appears in multiple rows of another table (e.g. event based lines of therapy), and I don't want to rectangle the data into a single flat file because it would complicate or mask necessary information.

A seemingly obvious solution here is Shiny, and that's certainly true when you have large data / are querying in real time against a database. However, if your data are small to mid-sized (MB, not GB), you can achieve the above goal in a single html page from R Markdown, without any Shiny server overhead. The following outlines a workflow I've been using to make this possible; something I wanted to document is how to use [[crosstalk]]{.pkg} when you're calling multiple [[DT]]{.pkg} `datatable` widgets in the same `filter_select()` call.

### Simulate data

Let's start by simulating some data that looks similar to what we would get from a clinical trial or other healthcare-related database. There will be three tables: demographics, treatments, and follow-up. The code to do this is a bit long, and ancillary to the main message of this post, so it's hidden below (but feel free to toggle and browse it if you wish!).

```{r simulate-data, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)

### Function to simulate follow up tables
sim_data_fup <- function(
  n = 100,
  dt_sim_start = "2000-01-01",
  dt_sim_end = "2019-12-31",
  seed = 12345
) {
  set.seed(seed)
  
  dt_sim_start <- as_date(dt_sim_start)
  dt_sim_end <- as_date(dt_sim_end)
  
  # generate patient IDs
  ids <- sample(111111:999999, n, replace = FALSE)

  # simulate the data table
  data_fup <- tibble(
    id = ids,
    ind_event = sample(0:1, n, replace = TRUE, prob = c(.8, .2)),
    dt_first_contact = sample(dt_sim_start:dt_sim_end, n) %>% as_date(),
  ) %>%
    mutate(
      dt_last_contact =
        dt_first_contact + sample(1:3000, n, replace = TRUE),
    ) %>%
    mutate(
      dt_last_contact =
        if_else(dt_last_contact > dt_sim_end, dt_sim_end, dt_last_contact)
    )
  
  data_fup
}

### Function to simulate demographics tables
### Accepts a vector of IDs (usually identified from the follow up table)
sim_data_demo <- function(
  ids, 
  age_range = 18:100,
  race_opts = c("Black", "White")
) {
  n = length(ids)
  
  data_demo <- tibble(
    id = ids,
    age = sample(age_range, n, replace = TRUE),
    sex = rep("F", n),
    race = sample(race_opts, n, replace = TRUE, prob = c(.2, .8)),
    ind_her2 = sample(0:1, n, replace = TRUE, prob = c(.2, .8))
  )  
  
  data_demo
}

### Function to simulate treatment tables
### Accepts a follow-up table for IDs and first/last contact dates
sim_data_trt <- function(
  data_fup,
  n_trt_opts = 4, #the maximum number of treatments any patient can have
  treatment_choices #a character vector of therapy options
) {
  n <- data_fup %>% n_distinct("id")
  n_trt_opts <- 1:n_trt_opts
  
  # initialize patient_trt table; we'll bind rows at the end of each loop iteration
  patient_trt <- tibble()
  
  for(i in 1:n) {
    n_trt <- sample(n_trt_opts, size = 1)
    
    ith_patient <- data_fup %>% slice(i) 
    
    ith_patient_trt <- ith_patient %>%
      select(id) %>%
      slice(rep(1, times = n_trt)) %>% # elongate the table with a row for each treatment
      mutate(
        trt = sample(treatment_choices, size = n_trt, replace = TRUE),
        dt_trt_start = sample(
          seq(ith_patient$dt_first_contact, ith_patient$dt_last_contact, by="days") %>%
            sort(),
          size = n_trt, replace = FALSE
        )
      ) %>%
      arrange(dt_trt_start) %>%
      mutate(
        dt_trt_end = lead(dt_trt_start) - 1,
        dt_trt_end = case_when(
          row_number() == n() ~ 
            sample(seq(last(dt_trt_start), ith_patient$dt_last_contact, by="days"), 1),
          TRUE ~ dt_trt_end
        )
      ) 
    
    patient_trt <- patient_trt %>% bind_rows(ith_patient_trt)
  } 
  
  patient_trt
}

# simulate follow-up data
data_fup <- sim_data_fup(n = 500)
# simulate demographic data
data_demo <- sim_data_demo(ids = data_fup$id)
# simulate treatment data
data_trt <- 
  sim_data_trt(
    data_fup, n_trt_opts = 5, 
    treatment_choices = c(
      "TRASTUZUMAB",
      "PACLITAXEL/CAPECITABINE",
      "PERTUZUMAB",
      "PACLITAXEL",
      "HERCEPTIN",
      "HERCEPTIN/PACLITAXEL"
    )
  )
```
</details>

Ultimately, we end up with 3 tables like the following, which we would like the end user to filter interactively by subject ID.
```{r}
data_fup
data_demo
data_trt
```

### Filter the tables with crosstalk

Since [`DT` is a `crosstalk` compatible widget](https://rstudio.github.io/crosstalk/widgets.html), it really only takes a few lines to get the desired outcome. The general strategy is to send your data frame into a new `SharedData` object with a line like `SharedData$new(my_data_frame)`. Often, a single `SharedData` object is sufficient for `crosstalk` to coordinate multiple widgets, such as on the [`crosstalk` examples page](https://rstudio.github.io/crosstalk/using.html). Sometimes though, you might want `crosstalk` to operate across several data frames with the same key, meaning you need multiple calls to `SharedData$new()`. The trick here is to use the `key` and `group` arguments in `SharedData$new()`.  In this case, `key = ~id` and we assign the name `group = "shared_obj"`. Next, we pass any of the `SharedData` objects to `filter_select()` which recognizes that the object belongs to a group. Something that was a "gotcha" for me: the `group` argument in `filter_select()` _is not_ the same as `group` in `SharedData`, rather, it's the values that populate the select box (in this case, `id`).

All of this comes together as follows:

```{r crosstalk-with-dt}
library(DT)
library(crosstalk)

# set up a group of SharedData objects
shared_demo <- SharedData$new(data_demo, key = ~id, group = "shared_obj")
shared_trt <- SharedData$new(data_trt, key = ~id, group = "shared_obj")
shared_fup <- SharedData$new(data_fup, key = ~id, group = "shared_obj")

# send the group to the filtering selection box
filter_select(
  id = "id-selector", label = "ID", 
  sharedData = shared_demo, group = ~id
)
```

**Demographics**

```{r demographics}
datatable(shared_demo)
```

**Treatment**

```{r treatment}
datatable(shared_trt)
```

**Follow-up**

```{r fup}
datatable(shared_fup)
```

## Summary

Note that this approach can work particularly well with [[rmdformats]]{.pkg} or other R Markdown theming. For example, here is the above workflow embedded in `rmdformats::robobook` which can be found in [this repo](https://github.com/tgerke/crosstalk-with-dt) with [corresponding interactive webpage](https://tgerke.github.io/crosstalk-with-dt/).
